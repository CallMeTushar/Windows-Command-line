# change directory 
1.cd - change directory 
eg: cd desktop

2.how to go back to previous directory??
ans : cd ..
	how to go back more than one directory??
		cd ../../..

3. we can also give path of the location where we want to go to the "cd" command
eg : cd taran/languages
this will take us inside the languages folder of taran directory

4. tired of typing whole path / whole file name !!!
	here is the solution for you
		type cd followed by first few keywords of folder/directory and hit "tab"
		and you will get suggestions

5.view content of a directory/folder
	-move to that directory using cd 
	-simply just type "dir" and hit enter
	this will list all the contents present in that directory /folder
what if we wanna see hidden files also !!!
just write "dir /a" this will list all files including hidden files and system hidden files
**caution: do not mess around with those hidden system files,that can be harmful for your system**

6. we learnt and tried some commands ... isn't our screen messed up with lots of commands!!!
lets clear our screen  type "cls" and hit enter

7.what if we wanna see only a particular extension files in a directory/folder
 eg : "dir *.jpg" 
 this will list all the .jpg extension files in that directory/folder
 similiarly we can write "dir *.exe" ,this will list all the .exe extension files present in that directory

8. do u need to execute command you just executed before? or command previous than this one?
  and lazy to write again? ugh... just use up and down arrow keys to go to previous command

9. if we write name of a file in our directory or we give its path then ... that file will be opened in the default program
